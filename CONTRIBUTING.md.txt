# Contributing
## Adding New Files
When you are adding a new file, follow these rules:
- ALWAYS use a pull request. Only the main devs should use direct commits.
- KEEP IT CLEAN - Make sure your code is properly indented, commented, etc.
- Describe your pull request. Tell us what you are doing with the code.
- Search the pull requests for what you are trying to change before creating yours. We will delete any duplicates.
- Most importantly, ensure that the change that you make to the code is necessary. Any uneccesary pull requests will be deleted.
- If you are trying to fix an issue, indicate what issue you are fixing in the description of your pull request.
You are also allowed to comment on pull requests, and you can suggest for how to fix any issues.
### DO NOT:
- Create pull requests that clean up code (unless we ask for help)
- Spam inappropriate or irresponsible comments or pull requests
- Change the base code
- Implement easter eggs (or anything similar) without permission from one of the devs
----
### When contributing, consider the following:
- Is it necessary?
- Could your code be cleaner?
- Is it something the main devs should do?
### When reviewing a pull request, consider the following:
- Is it necessary?
- Is it respectful?
- Would you like it if someone said that on your pull request?
